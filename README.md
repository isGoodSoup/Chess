## Chess on Java
I've wanted to do this for months, and now has become a reality. A Chess board, co-op, mouse clicking game written fully in Java 21. It follows same rules and legality as real chess and the code is largely based on RyiSnow's video on YouTube. Completed and rewritten a huge chunk of the code too.

I hope whoever tries and plays this, enjoy. :)
